"""IHK tibrosBB submission orchestration - separate from scraper.py since
it's a different external system with no shared logic.

submit_week() finds or creates the right week's entry and saves text into
it. sync_status() refreshes data/ihk_status.json, a local record of which
weeks are still editable vs already locked (genehmigt) - "Neuer Eintrag"
only ever creates the next sequential missing week, so the UI needs to
know in advance which weeks can actually be submitted before offering the
button (see AGENTS.md-style rationale in the plan doc).
